# GPIO Button Configuration
# Pin numbering uses BCM (Broadcom) mode
# These pins work identically on Pi 3B+ and Pi Zero 2 W (both have 40-pin headers)

buttons:
  toggle:
    pin: 5                    # BCM GPIO 5
    pull: "up"                # Internal pull-up resistor
    bounce_time: 0.2          # 200ms debounce time

# Button wiring:
# Connect one side of the button to GPIO 5
# Connect the other side to GND
# The pull-up resistor keeps the pin HIGH, button press pulls it LOW

# Button functionality:
# - On library screen: Opens selected book
# - On reader screen: Returns to library
# Same behavior as PiSugar2 long press
